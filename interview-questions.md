# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a way to make computations into one returned set of data, and you would use this to retieve one set of data after the function rather than many pieces of data to pick through

  Researched answer:A function is similar to a procedure- a set of statements that performs a task or calculate a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output when there is some obvious relationship between the input and output



2. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:Console log will log the given output from the function into the console, whereas return will simply give you the output from the parameter being met whether it is a statement, or anything

  Researched answer:The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have used a variable value.



3. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: An argument is what is being passed through the function, where as the parameter is the condition of the argument that must meet, contain within it to be returned

  Researched answer: Function parameters are the names listed in the functions definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer:A built in method is a type of procedure included in Javascript that will allow you to access different things depending on which you are using

  Researched answer:In JavaScript, built-in functions are the global functions that are called globally, rather than on an object



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:Proper pair programming starts with ensuring both have up to date documents and files, from there determinging roles. These are called driver: where one person displays their screen and writes all code, saves all files to github, to ensure smooth transition; the other: passenger, steers the driver with code to write while figuring out the problems with the driver, this could be writing and checking code, psuedocoding, or talking it out. It is the passengers responsibility to inform the driver of when to move on after they both grasp the concept

  Researched answer: An agile driven software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The programmers switch roles frequently



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I think not only giving us different people throughout the week shows where we need to learn and lets us learn from may different people, but it keeps you accountable for knowing the material. I also like that as we go over a topic, and explore new things, everything is explained with the why, and how we used this, and why we need to use it
